Zoom

This is the repostiory for the 2020 FRC season- Infinte Recharge. This code was delvoped by FRC Team #6505, Steel Boot Robotics. Visit https://steelboot.weebly.com/contact-us.html if you would like to inquire about it (we really should fill out the license file, although most FIRST projects use the FIRST BSD license (BSD 3 clause)).

Development for the 2021 season (a countiation of 2020) has been moved to [https://github.com/frc6506/Practice-Project](https://github.com/frc6506/Practice-Project) (It really should be renamed) and [https://github.com/frc6506/FRC-Robot-Characterization-2021](https://github.com/frc6506/FRC-Robot-Characterization-2021) .  Any remaining bugs will not be fixed here.
